# Data Structures - Week Implementation 🚀

This repository contains C++ implementations of fundamental data structures as part of a one-week intensive training at OppoTrain.

## 🗓️ Day 1 Implementations (16-7-2025)

### Implemented Data Structures:
- **Dynamic Array** (`DynamicArray.cpp`)  
  - A resizable array supporting dynamic resizing and basic operations like push_back and print.
  
- **Singly Linked List** (`SinglyLinkedList.cpp`)  
  - Linked list implementation supporting append, prepend, delete, and traversal.
  
- **Stack using Array** (`StackArray.cpp`)  
  - Stack implementation based on a fixed-size array with push, pop, peek, and print.
  
- **Stack using Linked List** (`StackLinkedList.cpp`)  
  - Stack implementation using singly linked list nodes with dynamic size.
