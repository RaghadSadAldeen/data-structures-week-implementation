# 📚 Data Structures One-Week Intensive Training @ OppoTrain

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains all data structure implementations completed during the **One-Week Intensive Training** at **OppoTrain**. The goal was to build a strong foundation in fundamental data structures, algorithms, and behavioral interview preparation in just **5 days**, with daily tasks and code submissions.

## 🧮 Time & Space Complexity Analysis

Each `.cpp` file includes detailed comments analyzing:

* Time Complexity (insert, delete, search, etc.)
* Space Complexity

| Data Structure     | Insert         | Delete       | Search         | Space  |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------ |
| Dynamic Array      | O(1) amortized | O(n)         | O(1)           | O(n)   |
| Singly Linked List | O(1)           | O(1)         | O(n)           | O(n)   |
| Stack (Array)      | O(1)           | O(1)         | O(n)           | O(n)   |
| Queue (Array)      | O(1)           | O(1)         | O(n)           | O(n)   |
| Doubly Linked List | O(1)           | O(1)         | O(n)           | O(n)   |
| Binary Search Tree | O(log n) avg   | O(log n) avg | O(log n) avg   | O(n)   |
| Hash Table         | O(1) avg       | O(1)         | O(1)           | O(n)   |
| Trie               | O(L)           | O(L)         | O(L)           | O(AL)  |
| Union-Find         | O(α(n))        | O(α(n))      | O(α(n))        | O(n)   |
| Min Heap           | O(log n)       | O(log n)     | O(1)           | O(n)   |
| Graph (List)       | O(1) per edge  | -            | O(V+E) BFS/DFS | O(V+E) |

## 🧪 How to Run the Code

Each `.cpp` file is self-contained and can be run individually using any C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ FileName.cpp -o program
./program
```

For example:

```bash
g++ Trie.cpp -o trie
./trie
```

## 📘 Behavioral Interview Preparation

* Signed up on **Exponent** ✅
* Scheduled and practiced 3 **mock behavioral interviews** ✅
* Prepared STAR responses for:

  1. Tell me about yourself
  2. Describe a challenge you faced
  3. A time you worked in a team
  4. A time you failed and what you learned
  5. A project you’re proud of

#### 📝 Self-Assessment:

* Strengths:

  * Confident communication
  * Clear problem articulation
  * Real-world examples with metrics
* Weaknesses:

  * Slight nervousness during first mock
  * Needed better transitions in STAR
* Improvements:

  1. Practice smoother transitions
  2. Quantify achievements more
  3. Reduce filler words ("um", "like")
