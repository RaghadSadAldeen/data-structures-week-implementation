# Data Structures - Week Implementation 🚀

This repository contains C++ implementations of fundamental data structures as part of a one-week intensive training at OppoTrain.

## 🗓️ Day 2 Implementations (17-7-2025)

### Implemented Data Structures:

- **Queue using Array** (`queue/queue_array.cpp`)  
  A fixed-size linear queue using arrays. Supports operations like `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `display`.

- **Queue using Linked List** (`queue/queue_linkedlist.cpp`)  
  A dynamic queue that grows as needed using singly linked list nodes. Supports basic queue operations.

- **Doubly Linked List** (`doubly_linked_list/doubly_linked_list.cpp`)  
  Each node contains pointers to both previous and next nodes. Enables forward and backward traversal and insertion.

- **Circular Linked List** (`circular_linked_list/circular_linked_list.cpp`)  
  The last node connects back to the first node, creating a circular structure. Useful for continuous loops.
